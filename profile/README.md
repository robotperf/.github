RobotPerf is an **open reference benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics computing performance** fairly with [ROS 2](https://accelerationrobotics.com/ros.php) as its common baseline, *so that robotic architects can make informed decisions about the hardware and software components of their robotic systems*.

| Mission | Vision | Standards |
|---|---|----|
|  Represented by consortium of robotics leaders from industry, academia and research labs, RobotPerf is formated as an open project whose mission is to build open, fair and useful robotics benchmarks that are technology agnostic, vendor-neutral and provide unbiased evaluations of robotics computing performance for hardware, software, and services. |  Benchmarking helps assess performance. Performance information can help roboticists design more efficient robotic systems and select the right hardware for each robotic application. It can also help understand the trade-offs between different algorithms that implement the same capability. | RobotPerf benchmarks aligns to robotics standards so that you <ins>don‚Äôt spend time reinventing the wheel and re-develop what already works</ins>. Benchmarks are conducted using [ROS 2](https://accelerationrobotics.com/ros.php) as its common baseline. RobotPerf also aligns to standardization initiatives within the ROS ecosystem related to computing performance and benchmarking such as [REP 2008](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/324) (ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Architecture and Conventions) and the [REP 2014](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/364) (Benchmarking performance in ROS 2).|
